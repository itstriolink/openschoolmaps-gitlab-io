*Teacher's Guide*

== Synopsis

.Aim
The aim of this guide is for teachers like you to be able to use uMap to create a site plan that can be used as a map.

.Example of a site plan created with uMap. Map data (C) OpenStreetMap Contributors

You can see the full example map at https://umap.osm.ch/de/map/sportevent-grundschule-wetzwil_1355#20/47.29694/8.62575. You may have to zoom in on the blue pins.

.Time Schedule
You will need about 10-15 minutes for the example. Any device with Internet access and the uMap website serve as a means.

[NOTE]
====
The international version of uMap is available at https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/de/, but we recommend that you use the Swiss version if your map is in Switzerland.

== What is uMap?
With uMap you can draw your own map on OpenStreetMap background. All drawings and objects are only visible on the map you have created. If you find missing buildings or streets on the map, you can log on to openstreetmap.org and add the missing objects there. Instructions for the online editor of OpenStreetMap can be found at  https://gitlab.com/OpenSchoolMaps/OpenSchoolMaps.ch/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/lehrmittel/umap/lageplan_erstellen.pdf?job=PDFs.

== Instructions for uMap

A school sports event is used as an example.

1. Visit https://umap.osm.ch
2. Select "Create a map"
3. Navigate to the place where you want to create a map, for example your school.
4. If you want to create a marker, click on the marker icon image:umap/stecknadel_icon.PNG["Marker icon", 25, 25] in the top right corner of the map. You can then place it on the map.

5. Another way is to click on the polyline image:umap/weg_icon.PNG["Polyline icon", 25, 25], for example to show how visitors get from the bus stop to the event, as we did here.

If you are satisfied with your site plan, you can click on the "Save" button in the upper right-hand corner. Otherwise, you can leave the editing mode by clicking on the "Disable editing", also at the top right.
You have now successfully created your first map with uMap!

uMap and the OpenSchoolMaps project are based on OpenStreetMap (https://osm.org).
