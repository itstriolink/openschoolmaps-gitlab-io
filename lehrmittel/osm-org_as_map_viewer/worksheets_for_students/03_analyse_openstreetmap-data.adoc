*A worksheet for students*

[NOTE]
====
This worksheet shows you how to use OSM.org to get a look at the data on which the map is based on.

You'll also learn how to make reports to the OpenStreetMap community about errors in the
on the map. 
This is how you can help to keep the OpenStreetMap running and up to date.

== A Look Behind The Scenes


=== Querying Features

You can know what data is behind an features on the map by using the object features. 
To do this, click on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/object_query_button.PNG["Query Features Button", 20, 20]-button on the right side of openstreetmap.org.

You should notice that your mouse pointer changes. 
Now, click on the approximate location on the map where you want to find out more information on. 
A list of the geographical features found there appears on the left. (There may also be some that are not shown on the map. 
The map layers does not neccessarily use all the the geographical features.)

Click on the features on the left panel, and you will be able to obtain additional information such as the Tags and Members of the selected features.

=== (All) Show Map Data

Especially with features that are not displayed on the map, it can be difficult to find and examine them in this way. 
Click on the small stack icon image:osm_editieren/osm_bearbeiten/osm_ebene_icon.PNG["Layer icon", 20, 20] above the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/info_button.PNG["Info Button", 20 , 20]-button on the right side. 
A sidebar with the map layers will pop out. 
At the bottom of the sidebar, select the "Map data" checkbox.

Do take note: before clicking the box you should zoom in as much as possible
so as to reduce the data that is being displayed. Otherwise, it can take some time for the browser to load.

The data features are placed all over the map,  blue circles for point features, lines for line features and boundaries of area features). 
These can be clicked on (even without the object query mode described above) to once again access the detailed view of the respective features.

== Help To Improve OpenStreetMap

As announced by the welcome message, the OpenStreetMap data is gathered by people like you. 
Even without training, you can help improve OpenStreetMap by reporting errors and omissions to the OpenStreetMap community.

Is the address of your school missing in OpenStreetMap? Is the whole school building missing? 
Or is there a bench, a well or a litter bin in the school's vicinity that has not yet been registered? 
Or did you even notice something on the map that is wrong or outdated?

=== Create Note

You can make a note to alert the OpenStreetMap community by clicking on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/note_button.PNG["Notiz Button", 20, 20]-button on the right.

Drag the position needle image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/needle_symbol.PNG["Needle Icon", 25, 25] out to the map. 
Move it, so that the bottom of the needle points as exactly as possible to the affected map area. 
Describe as exactly as possible in the text field what should be changed, added or wrong.

[NOTE]
====
Such a note does not change the map data or the maps.
You can use them like an easily removable adhesive label (also known as as "Post-It") on which you write something and place on a card. 
Notes will be submitted to experienced mappers who make the update if deemed neccessary.
So don't be afraid to make mistakes!

However, this also means that OpenStreetMap has not yet been improved with a note. 
So if you want to make a difference yourself, we recommend that you make the changes yourself (among other things, because it's fun).
There is an entry help for this on OpenSchoolMaps with the worksheet about editing OpenStreetMap.
