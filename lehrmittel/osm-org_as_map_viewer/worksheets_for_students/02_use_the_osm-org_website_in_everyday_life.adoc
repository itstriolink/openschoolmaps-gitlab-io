NOTE: In this worksheet you will learn how to toggle between the map layers, use the route planning and share the positions found on your map with others.

== Map Layers

Despite what the name suggests, OpenStreetMap is not really only a map. 
It is a collection of detailed geographical data from which computers can generate a map. And not just one map, but based on the same data different maps for different purposes.

Some of them can be selected from the OSM.org website. 
What you have seen so far is the OpenStreetMap default map layer. 
If you click on the small stack icon image:osm_editieren/osm_bearbeiten/osm_ebene_icon.PNG["Layer icon", 20, 20] above the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/info_button.PNG["Info Button", 20 , 20]-button on the right side, you can switch between these different map views.

== Navigation (route planning)

With the OpenStreetMap geodata collection, computers can do more than just "draw" maps! 
The search function uses these data and also freely available data from sources such as WikiData (a sister project of Wikipedia).

Finding your route from point A to point B is possible. 
It can be done by:

Clicking on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/navigation_button.PNG["Navigation Button", 25, 25]-button next to the search field. 
Now you can either enter text (e.g. address) for start and destination, or drag the red and green pins from the search form
to the desired place on the map.

Next, select your desired means of transport/ type of movement from the drop-down box below the start and destination field.

.Stopovers
[NOTE]
====
The specification of stopovers or "Via "s is unfortunately not available on openstreetmap.org. However, you can visit http://routing.osm.ch , another OpenStreetMap-based 
route planning option, where you can specify your stopovers 
(only available for routes within Switzerland; there are navigation tools available with worldwide coverage).

=== Task

Use the navigation function to find your direction to school from home and remember to change to your usual mode of transport.

How long would you normally take to get to the school?

====
ifdef::show_solutions[]
Your indication should be described in meters or kilometers.

Note: Public transport / timetable query is unfortunately not supported.

Does the predicted duration match your experience?

====
ifdef::show_solutions[]
If it is exactly the route you are taking, then the duration should be about right. 
If there are small deviations, then this is reflected naturally also in the duration.

Temporary (short-term) conditions that affect the duration of your trip to school, 
such as construction sites or accidents, are of course difficult for OSM to take 
into account, so there would be variations in the duration.

====

Does the proposed route match the one you normally take?

====
ifdef::show_solutions[]
If you live in a place with a high population density, such as a large city like Zurich, 
the answer is probably yes. On the other hand, if you live in a place with a low population 
density, then the answer is probably no. But why?

This is because in a place with a high population density the number of mappers and people 
interested in OSM is statistically higher and a large city like Zurich is more important 
than a small village in the canton of Uri. Thus, all possible routes that may exist 
(or at least most of them) will be available on OSM.

In a village with a low population density, there will probably be fewer mappers and those 
dealing with OSM. Also, mapping a small village is less important than mapping a big city. 
Therefore it may be that not all roads and paths are available in OSM and OSM can only 
calculate a limited number of routes.

{empty} +

====

Is the same route proposed for each means of transport?

====
ifdef::show_solutions[]
No, because not every means of transport is suitable/approved for every route. 
There are motorways which are only for certain motor vehicles, cycle routes for 
bicycles and similar vehicles and pure pedestrian routes which do not permit 
vehicles. There is also public transport. Trains and trams run defined routes 
along a rail and buses also have fixed routes along various bus stops.
endif::show_solutions[]
ifndef::show_solutions[]
{empty} +
endif::show_solutions[]
====

Why is it possible to propose a different route depending on the mode of transport?

====
ifdef::show_solutions[]
Not every means of transport is allowed everywhere: 
You are not allowed to drive through the pedestrian 
zone or on foot over the motorway.

Which route is the fastest can also depend on the 
chosen mode of transport:
A small detour in the car can be worthwhile in 
order to avoid a 30 zone. Cyclists and pedestrians 
are not slowed down by such a zone.

== Position sharing

You can get a link to send someone the map section or a marked place on your screen by clicking on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/share_button.PNG["Share Button", 20, 20]-button on the right.
