== Introduction 

Technology is an integral part of our everyday lives. 
This also includes maps and GPS navigation apps. 
Many people think of Google Maps, a school atlas or national maps such 
as the federal map viewer (map.geo.admin.ch). 
There are many alternatives - and one of them is OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
The advantage of OpenStreetMap is that the data belongs to the users 
(the community) and not to a company or an authority. 
However, this also presupposes that the data is supplemented and 
kept up-to-date by the users. 

It seems reasonable to us that the participants develop an awareness 
that the card belongs to them or to all of us and that we are all 
responsible for its quality. 
Participants should use OSM and actively participate in the improvement, 
for example on holiday when the area is insufficiently covered.

And cartography is neither boring nor difficult, so anyone should be able 
to learn it. One way to make cartography better known is to include it in 
lessons, such as geography or history. An outdoor mapping event 
should give an insight.

The checklist below contains a short list of the topics that are important 
to launch a successful event. It also gives an overview of the timing of the event.

== Checklist and Scheduling

The following is a checklist for teachers and instructors to prepare 
and carry out an outdoor mapping event:

1. Study of the documents
2. Execution of a test run
3. Integrating the data into OpenStreetMap
4. Preparations (e.g. defining groups, changeset comments, etc.)
5. Divide area and print map sections (part of preparation)
6. Introduction of the topic for the participants (part of the preparation)
7. After the event has taken place, evaluate and conclude the event.

The topics are discussed in more detail here, section by section.

Before that we show a table as an overview of the time schedule of the event.

There are different possibilities, depending on whether you are planning an 
outdoor mapping event within the framework of (A.) regular lessons, (B.) a 
project week at the school, or (C.) a project week outside the school. 
The following estimated timetable is given below:

.Scheduling Overview. 

== Study of the documents

Before you can successfully run an outdoor mapping event, you need to be 
familiar with the topic of OpenStreetMap. It would be a good idea to pick up the 
teaching materials from https://openschoolmaps.ch/[OpenSchoolMaps] a few weeks 
in advance and study them. The documents contain both theory and exercises to solve. 
Be prepared for possible questions from participants and take notes. 
If something is not completely clear, one can inform oneself in the internet. 
This is a good entry point https://osm.ch/hilfe.html[OSM.ch]. 
However, it should be possible to study the documents on one's own.

[NOTE]
====
The "Swiss OpenStreetMap Association" (SOSM) offers the possibility to ask questions 
if you are stuck: https://sosm.ch/en/contact/[Contact].
====

== Execution of a test run

Conscientious preparation includes not only studying the documents, 
but also carrying out a test run. Use a way home or go for a walk 
and apply your newly acquired knowledge. Explore the surroundings 
from the perspective of a cartographer. 

Take pen and paper with you on your walk. Use the map tools uMap 
or Field Papers as described below. Research which objects the 
participants could map (see below for more information).

There would also be the possibility to use the smartphone, for example 
with the app "OSMTracker for Android". However, this is associated with 
more organizational and explanatory effort and is subject to constant 
technical change.

Stop the time and see how long it will take you to explore the environment 
and how much information you can gather during this time.Then it will be 
easier for you to estimate how much time you are planning for the participants.

CAUTION: Make sure you schedule enough lessons. 
Mapping can take longer than you think, so plan generously!

== Integrating the data into OpenStreetMap

After you have collected your data, go to https://www.osm.org[OSM.org] 
and enter your data there. 

If you do not yet have an account with OpenStreetMap (OSM), now is the 
time to create one. 
See https://openschoolmaps.ch/[OpenSchoolMaps] under "Teaching Materials" 
for the worksheet "Edit OpenStreetMap" for further explanations and the 
"OpenStreetMap Tagging Cheatsheet".

Again, it might be an advantage if you look at how much time you need. 
Add a little extra to your measured time because participants are probably 
not as fast as you and the differences within the class can be considerable. 

OpenStreetMap always requires a so-called "changeset comment" before 
saving the edited data. An example of a changeset comment is 
_House numbers Bahnhofstrasse added_ or _Outdoor-Event School X 2019_. 
In the following chapter "Preparations" we come back to this comment.

[NOTE]
=====
Show your work to the participants as an introduction to the topic. 
This will give you a first impression.
=====

== Preparations

*Specify objects to map*: There are more than a thousand(!) object 
types in OpenStreetMap (so-called 'tags'), so you should suggest a 
selection of objects to the participants. In the corresponding worksheet 
"Mapping the surroundings yourself..." for students and enthusiasts 
there is a chapter "What can be mapped at outdoor events". OpenSchoolMaps 
also offers a multi-page "OpenStreetMap Tagging Cheatsheet".
If you think that most of the "nearby" objects are already registered 
in the selected environment and you don't really know what to do, you 
can contact the Swiss OpenStreetMap Association at the above mentioned contact.

*Set changeset comment*: Before saving the edited data, OpenStreetMap 
always requires a so-called "changeset comment". For an event to be evaluated, 
it is important that everyone uses the same changeset comment. 
Specify which changeset comment all should use. An example of a changeset 
comment is _Outdoor-Event School X 2019_.

*Define date*: For the execution date is not compelling - 
but naturally desirable - if beautiful weather is announced, 
since it concerns an outdoor activity. 
Possibly an alternative date could be set.

*Plan group division*: The participants should form groups to 
carry out the event, e.g. groups of two. This makes it more exciting 
for the participants and easier for the teacher or instructor to organise. 
Each group is to be assigned an area, as explained below.

*Set up E-Mail addresses (if not already done)*: To use services like 
OpenStreetMap you need an e-mail address. And for this use one must 
be older than 13 years according to Internet right. For 13- to 16-year-old 
participants, a parent or person authorized by the parent (a teacher, a debt 
administrator, or an instructor) can manage user accounts 
(https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use#II._Privacy[source]). 

There are many ways with which e-mail addresses participants should register, 
if they have not already registered themselves, so that we cannot make a recommendation here.

[NOTE]
====
At the following https://giswiki.hsr.ch/Micro_Mapping_Party_Rapperswil#E-Mail-Adressen_f.C3.BCr_Gruppe_oder_Klasse_einrichten[web page] 
you will find some tips on how you can set up e-mail addresses for the group 
while respecting privacy and data protection.
====

*Announce event as a summary*: Also OpenStreetMap knows rules - 
similar to a common or a school place. For example, it is important 
that those who edit can be contacted. An event like this is called 
organized editing and there are these https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing_Guidelines["Organized Editing Guidelines"]. 
We have shortened these guidelines for you. 

In accordance with the guidelines, you will be asked to fill in the 
following information and E-Mail it to the following contact: 
https://sosm.ch/en/contact/[SOSM].

Infrastructure and consumables:

* There should be a room available with enough computers with 
access to the Internet to integrate the collected data on 
OpenStreetMap.org. 
* The following chapter explains how to create printed map sections. 
* Procure any documents for the card notes. 
* Enough writing materials.

Please also note the checklist for preparation for the participants 
in the corresponding worksheet for students and enthusiasts.

== Divide area and print map sections

The area planned for the event must be narrowed down so that the 
participants do not have to cover too great a distance. 

It also makes sense to divide the area into smaller areas 
(so-called "perimeters") and assign them to groups. 
This does not map the same area twice.

Two web applications are particularly suitable for area 
division: uMap and Field Papers: 

* uMap is a map editor with which you can draw any area. 
On https://openschoolmaps.ch/[OpenSchoolMaps] there is a 
teaching material "Create a map with uMap". 
* Field Papers" is a specialized web application that 
allows you to create map sections and upload the notes 
made in the field so that you can see them directly when editing.

If you choose uMap, you can skip the following explanations on 
Field Papers and make sure that there are enough maps 
printed for all groups.

"*Field Papers "* is a web application that allows you to create 
a map from OpenStreetMap, print it out and add your own notes to it. 
When the notes are recorded on the card, they can be photographed 
(or scanned) and uploaded back to Field Papers. After the map is 
uploaded, you can call the OpenStreetMap editor iD directly with 
one click and see the notes as a base map. Here is a http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#background=custom:http://tiles.fieldpapers.org/snapshots/5mq7v8ph/{z}/{x}/{y}.png&map=18/47.22425/8.81875[example] 
where you can see a link that calls the editor with parameters. 
Now you can capture the data in the OpenStreetMap iD-Editor and 
see the photographed notes in the background.

For Field Papers you need a computer, a printer with A4 paper 
and a digital camera (e.g. smartphone-camera).

Below is a summary of the procedure with field papers:

1. Go to http://fieldpapers.org/[Field Papers].
2. Register if necessary. 
3. Give the map a name and navigate to the area you want to map.
4. Print the maps ("Atlas").
5. Go outside and make a note of what you see.
6. Back at the computer, either just look at the paper notes as an aid;
7. or take a photo of the paper notes (also scanning goes) and upload 
the photo or scan to Field Papers.
8. Start the iD-Editor directly with the weblink to Field Papers.
9. Capture the data with the OpenStreetMap editor. 

Visit Field Papers' http://fieldpapers.org/about[website] and the 
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Field_Papers[OSM Wiki] for more information.

== Introduction of the topic for the participants

Before you divide participants into groups and send them off to explore 
the environment, you should introduce them to the topic. This is because the 
level of knowledge within the class/group in the field of computer science can 
be very high and not everyone knows what OpenStreetMap is and what its purpose is. 
It is best to prepare a short presentation and present everything you have learned 
and know in the documents. Take time to clarify open questions and make sure that 
the participants have understood everything.

== Evaluate and complete event

At the end of the event the participants should evaluate their results and present 
them to everyone. The evaluation can either be done individually or per group. The 
evaluation includes before-and-after comparisons of the map sections, statistical 
evaluations and personal reflection. The presentations can of course be graded if 
desired by the instructor. Instead of a presentation one could also arrange a kind 
of documentation of the work and possibly grade it. 

After evaluating the event and presenting the results, it would also be useful if 
you were to draw a conclusion: What was good? What was not so good? What can you 
do better next time? What did the class learn? You could record these findings 
in a report.

[NOTE]
====
The changeset comment that you have set and that the participants (hopefully) 
have given while editing can be used to make an analysis of the work done. 
The changeset comment can be entered in the following web application, 
where you will get statistics (over the last 30 days): 
https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?#8/46.856/8.405 . 
With "Search for a specific Text" you can e.g. enter "Switzerland" for a test.

Feedback on the event to the initiators of OpenSchoolMaps would 
also be great: see https://openschoolmaps.ch/[OpenSchoolMaps]
