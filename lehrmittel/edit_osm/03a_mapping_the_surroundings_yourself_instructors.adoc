== Introduction 

Technology is an integral part of our everyday lives. 
This also includes maps and GPS navigation apps. 
Many people think of Google Maps, a school atlas or national maps such 
as the federal map viewer (map.geo.admin.ch). 
There are many alternatives - and one of them is OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
The advantage of OpenStreetMap is that the data belongs to the users 
(the community) and not to a company or an authority. 
However, this also presupposes that the data is supplemented and 
kept up-to-date by the users. 

It seems reasonable to us that the participants develop an awareness 
that the card belongs to them or to all of us and that we are all 
responsible for its quality. 
Participants should use OSM and actively participate in the improvement, 
for example on holiday when the area is insufficiently covered.
