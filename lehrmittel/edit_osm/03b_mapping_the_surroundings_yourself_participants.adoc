== Overview

.Goal
The goal of this worksheet is to impart knowledge in the field of OpenStreetMap
(OSM) and cartography, so that pupils and other interested parties are able to 
map the surroundings or another area independently on the instruction of the 
teacher or instructor.

.Target group
Pupils and other enthusiasts.

.Scheduling
Depending on your previous knowledge, the processing of 
this worksheet requires different amounts of time, 
but at least three hours. 

This is the rough schedule of an outdoor event:

1. General preparations (e.g. what is OpenStreetMap?); min. approx. 20 min.
2. Concrete preparation for outdoor mapping; min. approx. 20 min.
3. Mapping outside; min. 60 min, better two to three hours.
4. Instruction for editing OpenStreetMap; min. approx. 20 min.
5. Editing on the computer; at least about one hour, better two hours.

== Introduction 

The following topics are covered in this worksheet:

* What is OpenStreetMap?
* What's being mapped? What not?
* What can be mapped at outdoor events?
* Preparations for outdoor mapping 
* How to edit OpenStreetMap?

=== What is OpenStreetMap (OSM)?

OpenStreetMap is an international project similar to Wikipedia 
in which volunteers collect geodata that is then used by 
countless applications.
The OSM data belongs to the community and - in contrast to 
Google Maps or national maps such as the map viewer of the 
federal government (map.geo.admin.ch) - can be reused under 
a free license. 

OpenStreetMap can be used in many different ways and users can 
have different goals. In the following we have compiled a few possible 
uses of OpenStreetMap:

* Navigation at the computer (e.g. OSM.org) or with the Smartphone (e.g. Maps.Me)
* Background map or location map embedded in web pages
* Location and hiking map
* Interactive web maps of all kinds (e.g. a castle map)
* Spatial analyses (e.g. Nebelkarte.ch)
