A guide for the interested, for pupils and for instructors/teachers

== Overview

.Goal
The goal of this guide is to show how to get OpenStreetMap data and use it in QGIS 3.

.Audience
Anyone who is interested in creating their own map (online, as a printable plan) 
and in analysing geodata.

.Scheduling
This worksheet requires different amounts of time depending on your previous 
knowledge, since you can skip individual sections if you are already familiar 
with the topic in question.

.Structure
The following topics will be covered:

* Introduction with explanations of OpenStreetMap and geoinformation 
systems as well as common file formats
* Extract OpenStreetMap data with Overpass
* Import OpenStreetMap data directly into QGIS with QuickOSM plugin
* Various web tools for downloading OpenStreetMap data
* Merge Polygon Layers with Point Layers in QGIS
* Filter or rule-based display of objects with QGIS

We recommend at least reading the introduction and extracting the 
chapter OpenStreetMap data with overpass.

[NOTE]
====
This tutorial is about using existing data from OpenStreetMap. 
If you want to record data yourself, you can use the worksheets 
"Edit OpenStreetMap" and "Create a thematic online map with uMap" 
as well as https://learnosm.org/de/ for more information.
====

== Introduction

The data from OpenStreetMap comes in different data formats.
Therefore we will first explain some of these file formats in more detail.

=== OpenStreetMap and geoinformation systems

The geometry of the objects in OpenStreetMap (OSM) are stored internally 
as topological structures (nodes, ways). 
And the object attributes as tags (key-value pairs) only partially structured. 
This data schema, which can be extended at will, must first be converted for 
geoinformation systems (GIS) and their formats. 
There is no single GIS data schema for OSM. 
Hardly any export from OSM is therefore the same as the other.

=== File formats

Basically, one can distinguish between OSM's own and analyzable GIS formats.

* OSM-specific formats are mainly OSM XML, and OSM PBF.
* GIS compatible formats are GeoJSON, Geopackage (and related: MBTile/SQLite), 
Shapefiles, GeoJSON (TopoJSON).
* Other GIS vector formats are: KML and GPX for GPS data exchange.
* Other formats that cannot be analysed further are image/raster formats such as PNG, JPEG, SVG and PDF.

The following describes various methods for importing OpenStreetMap data into QGIS. 
The first method works with Overpass-Turbo, a web service for querying OpenStreetMap data. 
We recommend that you look at this method as it is the most efficient of all the methods presented. 
The second method is based on QuickOSM, a plugin for QGIS in which queries can be created. 
If you've read or read the overpass turbo section, you can consider it optional with QuickOSM. 

After the two inport methods further tools are introduced, for example the HOT Export Tool or OSMaxx. 

Finally, you will learn how to merge different layers in QGIS. 
This chapter is referred to at the end of the remaining chapters, so you'll come there for or after.

== Extract OpenStreetMap data with Overpass

The easiest and fastest way to import OpenStreetMap data into QGIS is by overpass turbo. 
This method is suitable for advanced as well as for beginners. First visit the Overpass-Turbo 
website at: http://overpass-turbo.osm.ch/.

When you first visit the website, it looks something like this:

.Startseite von Overpass-Turbo
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/startseite.PNG[]

Click on the red marked "Wizard" button. The wizard makes it easy to create overpass queries. 
Since we are looking for bread outlets as an example, we are looking for bakeries and 
supermarkets as both sell bread. As a locality we take Uster as an example. 
The query looks like this (_bakery or supermarket in Uster_):

.Overpass-Turbo Wizard-Abfrage
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/wizardAbfrage.PNG[]

After clicking on "Create and execute query" you will get the following:

.Resultat der Wizard-Abfrage
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/resultat.PNG[]

The above result can also be simplified by replacing the "nodes", "ways" and 
"relations" to "nwr" (=noses/ways/relations). In the lower right corner you can 
see the different objects marked in red. We have 22 POIs and 5 polygons. 
Since we only want POIs, we could use "out center;" to turn all areas and paths into points. 
The new query should look like this.

    [out:json][timeout:25];
    {{geocodeArea:Uster}}->.searchArea;
    (
        nwr["shop"="bakery"](area.searchArea);
        nwr["shop"="supermarket"](area.searchArea);
    );
    out center;

If we now copy the upper lines and paste them into the overpass turbo 
as a query and execute them, we get the following:

.Ãœberarbeitetes Resultat
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/resultatNeu.PNG[]

Now we see in the lower right corner that the displayed objects consist only of POIs. 
We now have 27 POIs and 0 polygons, because we have converted the 5 polygons to POIs 
via "out center" and Overpass has added these 5 new POIs to the existing 22 POIs. 
Now we have to save the query as GeoJSON. To do this, go to "Export" in the upper 
left corner of "Wizard". The window that appears gives us various export options: 
We choose the top one, i.e. "Save as GeoJSON".

.Overpass Export
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/overpass_export.PNG[]

We now add the downloaded GeoJSON file to the left layer menu in QGIS using Drag & Drop. 
In addition, we rename the layer appropriately, for example "Bread outlets".

Our QGIS now looks like this:

.GeoJSON in QGIS importiert
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/brotverkaufsstellen_QGIS.PNG[]

As you have probably noticed, an OSM standard layer is used here as a 
background to present the data more clearly. I assume that you don't have this one, 
but that's not too bad, because it's not absolutely necessary. So you can continue 
without OSM standard layer as background.

Finally, we want to change the coordinate system of the GeoJSON imported into QGIS 
and save it as a GeoPackage. To do this, right-click on the layer, go to "Export" 
and select the top entry "Save Feature As...". We change the KBS to "EPSG:2056 - 
CH1903+/LV95" and give the file a name. We leave the format as GeoPackage and click on "OK".

Below you can see the export window:

.Als GeoPackage exportieren
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/brotverkaufsstellen_gpkg.PNG[]

Very good, you managed to import OpenStreetMap data into QGIS and save it as a new format. 
The other way to import OpenStreetMap data into QGIS is using the QuickOSM plugin, 
which is explained below. If you are not interested or have already read it, you can jump 
to the chapters "Merging Polygon Layers with Point Layers in QGIS" or 
"Filtering Objects with QGIS or Rule-Based Displaying".

== Import OpenStreetMap data directly into QGIS with QuickOSM plugin

Now let's look at another way to import and manage OpenStreetMap data into QGIS. 
It is best to delete the previously created layer and start at zero to avoid confusion.

.QGIS
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/osm_in_qgis.PNG[]

First we install the plugin called QuickOSM, which can be used to create queries directly in QGIS. 
To do this we go to "Extensions" in the upper menu bar and then to "Manage and install extensions...". 
Enter QuickOSM in the search field and since there is only one plugin under this name, you should see the correct one. 
Now click on "Install extension" and you are ready to work with the plugin.

The following picture shows the installation of the plugin:

.QuickOSM Installation
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/quick_osm.png[]

Now we open the plugin by clicking on "Vector" in the menu bar and then on "Quick OSM". 
Then we enter the following query to search for bakeries in Uster:

.Bakery-Abfrage
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/quickOSM_bakery.PNG[]

After the query has been executed, we make a second query to search for supermarkets:

.Supermarket-Abfrage
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/quickOSM_supermarket.PNG[]

Now you should have the following layers:

.Ergebnisse der QuickOSM-Abfragen
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/abfrage_ergebnisse.PNG[]

If you want to know how to convert polygon layers into point layers or how to filter 
objects, have a look at the chapters "Merging polygon layers with point layers in QGIS" 
or "Filtering objects with QGIS or rule-based display".

== Various web tools for downloading OpenStreetMap data

In this chapter we have compiled various web tools for downloading OpenStreetMap data. 
None of these tools are the same. Some require that you register and all are accessible 
free of charge and are provided without warranty.

=== OSM.org

On https://openstreetmap.org you can also download data. 
However, these can only be obtained as square sections and up to a 
maximum of 50,000 nodes and also only in `OSM XML` format.

If you want to know how to convert polygon layers into point layers or how to filter 
objects, see the chapters "Merging polygon layers with point layers in QGIS" 
or "Filtering objects with QGIS or rule-based display".

=== Geofabrik downloads

The website of Geofabrik http://download.geofabrik.de/ offers OpenStreetMap data 
for whole countries and regions, which are of course freely usable. The data can be stored there 
as Shapefiles (`.shp.zip`) or in the OSM-specific formats `.osm.pbf` and `.osm.bz2`.

The data are divided into individual regions. 
If you click on a region, the data of the countries in this region will be displayed. 
Depending on the country, you can also download smaller excerpts from the country. 
If you hold the mouse pointer over a region or a country, you will see the respective 
area in the map on the right side of the website. The data on GeoFabrik is updated 
every 24 hours with the data from OpenStreetMap. This means that if you have just made 
your own changes in OpenstreetMap, you have to wait at least a day until they are available 
at Geofabrik. Make sure what data you are downloading, as some can be several gigabytes in size.

The Shapefile is a GIS vector format and thus structured according to certain layers ('feature classes'). 
To find certain objects, such as bakeries (in OSM Tag shop=bakery) or supermarkets (Tag shop=supermarket) 
you need to consult the documentation of the Layered GIS Format at 
https://www.geofabrik.de/de/data/shapefiles.html[Geofabrik] - or the data itself.

If you want to know how to convert polygon layers into point layers or how to filter 
objects, see the chapters "Merging polygon layers with point layers in QGIS" 
or "Filtering objects with QGIS or rule-based display".

=== HOT Export Tool

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) offers an online service with the HOT 
Export Tool to download data from OpenStreetMap. To use the HOT ExportTool you need 
an OpenStreetMap user account and a valid email address to be notified when the data 
is ready for download. After logging in you will see the following points and tabs

1. Describe
2. Formats
3. Data
4. Summary 


Tabulators 1 and 4 are described in more detail below.

Tab 1 is about giving the file to be exported a name and a description. 
The picture below shows an example of exporting bread outlets in Uster.

.HOT Export Tool Tab 1 "Exportbeschreibung".
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/hotosm_tab1.PNG[]

Then you can select the data you want to download in different ways.

You can either:

* Enter a locality in the search
* Specify a Bounding Box with Coordinates
* Download the current view
* Draw a Bounding Box yourself
* Draw a polygon
* Upload a polygon as GeoJSON file

For the first two possibilities, only the search field has to be used. 
There you can specify either the desired town or a bounding box (west, south, east, north).

To draw a bounding box or polygon, press the _Draw_ button on the right side of the map. 
To download the current view, press the _This View_ button. 
If you want to upload a GeoJSON file, you can do so with the _Import_ button.

CAUTION: At this point a little excursion how to create a GeoJSON file.

The website http://geojson.io is a well-known website that allows you to edit GeoJSON.

The HOT Export Tool expects only simple GeoJSON objects (no 
"FeatureCollection"), i.e. a polygon type and a list of coordinates.

GeoJSON files from geojson.io and other sources must therefore be adapted manually. 
Therefore open the GeoJSON file in a text editor and simplify the structure similar to the following picture.

.Einzelnes GeoJSON-Objekt fÃ¼r das HOT Export Tool
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/json_format.png[]

Let's continue with the HOT Export Tool again. 
In tab 2 you choose the format, e.g. GeoPackage.

.HOT Export Tool Tab 2 "Formate".
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/hotosm_tab2.PNG[]

With tab 3 "Data" you change to the register "YAML" and insert the following:

    gastronomy:
     types:
       - points
       - polygons
     select:
       - name
       - addr:city
       - amenity
       - opening_hours
     where: amenity IN ('restaurant','fast_food','cafe','bar','pub')
    bakeries:
     types:
       - points
       - polygons
     select:
       - name
       - addr:city
       - shop
       - opening_hours
     where: shop IN ('bakery','supermarket')

The whole thing will look like this:

.HOT Export Tool Tab 3 "Data".
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/hotosm_tab3.PNG[]

After you've done that, we can almost export the query as a GeoPackage. 
That's why we go on to Tab 4. The last thing we have to do before exporting 
is to search for "Uster" on the right side of the map. Then it will be zoomed in:

.HOT Export Tool Uster
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/hotosm_uster.PNG[]

Once you have done this, you can click on the "Create Export" button (see below).

.HOT Export Tool Tab 4 "Summary".
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/hotosm_tab4.PNG[]

If you want to know how to convert polygon layers into point layers or how to filter 
objects, see the chapters "Merging polygon layers with point layers in QGIS" 
or "Filtering objects with QGIS or rule-based display".

=== OSMaxx

With OSMaxx, excerpts from OpenStreetMap can be downloaded in various GIS formats, 
not just by country, but in any desired format.

To use OSMaxx you need an OSM account with a valid email address.

Existing excerpts can be downloaded under _Existing Excerpt / Country_. You can 
choose in which format the file should be downloaded, which coordinate system 
should be used and how many details should be displayed.

Under _New Excerpt_ you can select your own areas of OpenStreetMap that you want to download. 
You can draw a rectangle or a polygon over the map. Again you can choose in which format the 
file should be downloaded, which coordinate system should be used and how many details should be displayed.

Exporting the data takes at least about 45 minutes. 

If you have chosen a GIS format and want to know if and where it has bakeries, 
for example, go to the "About" page of OSMaxx, where the data scheme is documented.

If you want to know how to convert polygon layers into point layers or how to filter 
objects, see the chapters "Merging polygon layers with point layers in QGIS" 
or "Filtering objects with QGIS or rule-based display".

=== BBBike

BBBike https://extract.bbbike.org/ offers the data of Planet.osm in many different file formats.

Only a bounding box has to be created for the extraction. The bounding box can have a maximum 
size of 24'000'000 kmÂ², or 512mb as a file. After you have entered a valid email address and 
assigned a name to the extraction you can click on the _Extract_ button. A notification will 
be sent to you by e-mail with the download link. The documentation of the schema behind the 
GIS formats like GeoPackage or Shapefile can be found here:

* http://www.geopackage.org/spec/
* https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf

If you want to know how to convert polygon layers into point layers or how to filter 
objects, see the chapters "Merging polygon layers with point layers in QGIS" 
or "Filtering objects with QGIS or rule-based display".

== Merge Polygon Layers with Point Layers in QGIS

With OSM, it happens again and again that an object - such as a bakery - 
is sometimes captured as a point and sometimes as a building outline polygon. 
This is why it often happens that you get polygon layers in GIS with the same object types as in point layers. 
Actually, however, one wants to address all objects uniformly and all at once.

So given a polygon layer and a point layer, we have to convert the polygons 
in the polygon layer to points and can then integrate them in the point layer. 

To do this, go to "Geometry Tools" in the "Vector" menu of QGIS and then to "Centroids...". 
After that the QGIS should look like this, where the names of the new layers have already been renamed:

.Polygon-Layer umgewandelt
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/vier_punktelayer.PNG[]

Since we now have several point layers, we have to merge them. 
Such a merge only works if all layers have the same geometry data type. 
Go to "Data Management Tools" in the QGIS "Vector" menu and then to "Merge Vector Layers". 
Select the four layers in the dialog window:

.Mehrere Layer zu einem einzigen Layer zusammenfÃ¼hren
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/vektorlayer_zusammenfuehren.PNG[]

After you have done this, you will see a new layer on the left. 
Now you don't need the old layers anymore and you can delete them. 
The new layer has the name "Merged". 
It would make sense if you renamed it "Bread Stores." 
Below you can see the final result of this second method, 
where the layer has not (yet) been renamed:

.Endergebnis
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/brotverkaufsstellen_QGIS.PNG[]

== Filter or rule-based display of objects with QGIS

After you have received OpenStreetMap data in the desired section, you may not want to work with all data. 
There are two fundamentally different methods of obtaining a subset of the data: 
On the one hand, the data source can be filtered according to self-defined criteria. 
On the other hand, you can display the data based on rules, so that only those 
data are displayed that comply with the rules.

In the following we look at the two methods. 
The example of bread outlets remains the same. 
The bread outlets contain both "bakeries" and "supermarkets". 
But now we only want to process and display "bakeries" in QGIS. 

=== Filter objects with QGIS

In QGIS there are two dialog options for filtering objects: 
Either you go to "Layer" in the menu and then select "Filter..." (while the desired layer is selected). 
Or you can right-click on the desired layer and go to "Filter...". Then a dialog with the title 
"Query creation" opens. In this window you can see the following:

* Fields: A list of all attributes that the selected layer contains.
* Values: The values on the selected attribute that occur in the layer 
(to display some values, click on the "Sample" button)
* Operators: Logical operators for linking fields and values.
* Data provider-specific filter expression: SQL expression for filtering attributes and values

In the input field "Data provider-specific filter expression" we enter the following:

    "shop"='bakery'

"shop" is the attribute (note the double quotes). 
'bakery' is the value (note the single quotation marks).

The window should look like this:

.Objekte filtern
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/filtern.PNG[]

Now click on "OK". Now you should get the message that about 10 objects were 
found which have the value "bakery" at the attribute "shop". We only see those 
objects that meet the filter criterion. All other objects are no longer part 
of the layer's data source:

.BÃ¤ckereien in Uster
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/uster_bÃ¤ckereien.PNG[]

As you can see above, you should now rename the layer from "Bread shops" to "Bakeries".

=== Rule-based display of objects with QGIS

The rule-based representation is about displaying all objects that fulfill a 
criterion from a layer data source. One also speaks of "data-driven representation". 
This expression, which has to be filtered by, is part of the representation (symbology) 
and not part of the layer as with the other method. 

The rule-based display can also be used to _not_ display individual values. 
In our example we want to take advantage of this to show only bakeries ('bakery') 
and not supermarkets ('supermarket'). To do this we right-click on the layer and 
click on the bottom entry "Properties...". In the left list menu we click on "Display" 
(third entry). Now it should look like this for you:

.Darstellung von Objekten
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/single_symbol.PNG[]

In the upper picture you see a red mark around the entry "Single symbol". 
This is because we are now changing this entry to "Rule-based". 
Previously, all objects were treated the same (not differentiated) 
and thus displayed in the same way, therefore "single symbol". 
Now that we have selected "Rule-based", we can define rules (expressions) 
to assign objects to different symbols according to attribute values.

.Objekte ohne Filter
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/kein_Filter.PNG[]

In the picture above you can see that we have an entry. 
This entry contains all 27 objects, and we see that no rules are defined on these objects. 
Therefore we click twice on the entry. 
In the text field next to "Filter" we enter the following again:

     "shop"='bakery'

It'll look that way:

.Edit Rule Dialog
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/edit_rule.PNG[]

Now we click on "OK". We see that the entry no longer says "(no filter)", but "shop"='bakery'. 
Now we click on "Apply" and then again on "OK". In QGIS this should now look like this:

.BÃ¤ckereien in Uster
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/uster_bÃ¤ckereien_nach_regeln.PNG[]

We see that we still have 27 objects. However, we are only shown the 10 objects 
that fulfill the rule, i.e. only bakeries. Maybe you have noticed it already, 
because in contrast to that the number of objects changes with the simple filter (see above). 
There not only the 10 bakeries are shown, but the number of objects is also reduced to 10. 
This is a particular difference between "normal" filtering and rule-based representation. 
Let's look at another possibility.

Assuming that we still want to display all objects and only part of them, we can 
simply use a different color for all bakeries. Delete the rule we applied to the objects earlier. 
Then we start from the following view:

.Objekte ohne Filter
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/kein_Filter.PNG[]

At the bottom left we click on the plus sign. 
Now we have copied our objects and apply the rule to this copy. 
So enter the following again and click on "OK":

.Edit Rule Dialog
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/edit_rule.PNG[]

Now we click on "Apply" and then on "OK". 
Now it should look like this in QGIS:

.Brotverkaufsstellen mit farblich abgegrenzten BÃ¤ckereien (Pink)
image::osm_editieren/osm-daten_beziehen/brotverkaufsstellen_regelbasiert.PNG[]

The "Bread outlets" layer should now have two different object groups. 
On the one hand, we see all 27 bread outlets in orange. 
On the other hand, we now have a new (sub-)group with 10 objects, 
namely our bakeries in pink.

This concludes this chapter or worksheet and leaves it to you to 
extend the layers and the whole QGIS project and improve the display.
