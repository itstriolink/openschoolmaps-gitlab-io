*A worksheet for students*

NOTE: In this worksheet you will learn how to toggle between the map layers, use the route planning and share the positions found on your map with others.

== Map Layers

Despite what the name suggests, OpenStreetMap is not really a map. It is a collection of detailed geographical data from which computers can generate a map. And not just one map, but - based on the same data - different maps for different purposes.

Some of them can be selected from the openstreetmap.org website. What you have seen so far is the OpenStreetMap default map layer. If you click on the small stack icon image:osm_editieren/osm_ebene_icon.PNG["Layer icon", 20, 20] above the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/info_button.PNG["Info Button", 20 , 20]-button on the right side, you can switch between these different map views.

== Navigation (route planning)

With the OpenStreetMap geodata collection, computers can do more than "just" draw maps! The search function uses these data and also free ly available data from sources such as WikiData (a sister project of Wikipedia).

Finding your route from point A to point B is possible. It can be done by:

Click on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/navigation_button.PNG["Navigation Button", 25, 25]-button next to the search field. Now you can either enter text (e.g. address) for start and destination, or drag the red and green pins from the search form
to the desired place on the map.

Next, the drop-down box below the start and destination field allows you to choose your means of transport/ type of movement to get to your destination.

.Stopovers
[NOTE]
====
The specification of stopovers or "Via "s is unfortunately not available on openstreetmap.org. However, you can visit http://routing.osm.ch ,another OpenStreetMap-based 
route planning option, where you can specify your stopovers (only available for routes within Switzerland).

=== Task

Use the navigation function to find your direction to school from home and remember to change to your usual mode of transport.

How long would you normally take to get the school?

(Public transport / timetable query is unfortunately not supported.)

Indication is in meters or kilometers

Compare it with the estimated time taken generated by openstreetmap.org, is the estimation accurate?

Does the proposed route matches the one you normally take?

Try changing the mode of transport, is the proposed route the same?

Why do you think that the means of transport will result in a different route be suggested?

////
Nicht jedes Verkehrsmittel ist überall erlaubt:
Mit dem Auto darf man nicht durch die Fussgängerzone,
zu Fuss nicht über die Autobahn.

Auch welche Strecke die schnellste ist,
kann von der gewählten Fortbewegungsart abhängen:
Im Auto kann sich ein kleiner Umweg lohnen,
um eine 30er-Zone zu vermeiden. Velofahrerinnen
und Fussgänger werden von einer solchen nicht
ausgebremst.

Not every means of transport is allowed everywhere:
Cars are not allowed in the pedestrian zone,
on foot not on the highway.

Also which route is the fastest,
can depend on the selected mode of transport:
A short detour in the car can be worthwhile,
to avoid a 30 zone. cyclists
and pedestrians are not affected by such
thwarted.

== Position sharing

You can get a link to send someone the map section or a marked place on your screen by clicking on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/share_button.PNG["Share Button", 20, 20]-button on the right.
