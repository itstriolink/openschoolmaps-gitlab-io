*A worksheet for students*

[NOTE]
====
This worksheet shows you how to openstreetmap.org to get a look at the data on which the map is based on.

You'll also learn how to make report to the OpenStreetMap community about errors in the
on the map. This is how you can help to keep the OpenStreetMap running and to keep them up to date.

== A Look Behind The Scenes


=== Querying Objects

You can know what data is behind an object on the map by using the object query. To do this, click on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/object_query_button.PNG["Query Features Button", 20, 20]-button on the right side of openstreetmap.org.

You should notice that in your mouse pointer changes. Now click on the approximate location on the map where the object in question is located. A list of the geographical objects found there appears on the left. (There may also be some that are not shown on the map. The map layers does not neccessarily use all the the geographical objects.)

Click on the appropriate link and you will see the properties ("Attributes") of the object as well as the comment on the last change made to it and further information.

=== (All) Show Map Data

Especially with objects that are not displayed on the map, it can be difficult to find and examine them in this way. Click on the small stack icon image:osm_editieren/osm_ebene_icon.PNG["Layer icon", 20, 20] above the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/info_button.PNG["Info Button", 20 , 20]-button on the right side. A sidebar with the map layers will pop out. At the bottom of the sidebar, select the "Map data" checkbox.

Do take note: before ticking the box you should zoom in as much as possible
so as to reduce the data that is being displayed. Otherwise, it can take some time for the browser to load.

The data objects are placed over the map as blue circles (for point objects) and lines (for line objects and boundaries of area objects). These can be clicked on (even without the object query mode described above) to once again access the detailed view of the respective object.

== Help To Improve OpenStreetMap

As announced by the welcome message, the OpenStreetMap data is gathered by people like you. Even without training, you can help improve OpenStreetMap by reporting errors and omissions to the OpenStreetMap community.

Is the address of your school missing in OpenStreetMap? Is the whole school building missing? Or is there a bench, a well or a litter bin in the school's vicinity that has not yet been registered? Or did you even notice something on the map that is wrong or outdated?

=== Create Note

You can make a note to alert the OpenStreetMap community by clicking on the image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/note_button.PNG["Notiz Button", 20, 20]-button on the right.

On the map a position needle image:osm-org_als_kartenviewer/needle_symbol.PNG["Positions-Nadel", 25, 25]. Move it so that the bottom of the needle points as exactly as possible to the affected map area. Describe as exactly as possible in the text field what should be changed or added or what is currently wrong.

[NOTE]
====
An OpenStreetMap note does not change the map data or the maps.
You can use them like an easily removable adhesive label (also known as
as "Post-It") on which you write something and place on a card. So don't be afraid to make mistakes!

But this also means that by creating a note, the database of OpenStreetMap is not changed yet. If you really want to make a difference yourself, we hope that you can make the changes in the edit mode instead(among other things, because it's the most fun).
