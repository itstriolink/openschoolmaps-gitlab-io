== Präsentation und Ausgabe von Daten

In the last few chapters
you've learned
how geodata is captured,
administered and analyzed.
In the last chapter
it's about
the P of EVAP,
the presentation
of the data.

=== Learning objectives

After this chapter
you will be able to
to do the following:

* output the results
of your queries
in GIS in suitable
form
* name the important
map elements

=== Theory

There are
different possibilities
to present or provide the visualized,
newly recorded
or changed data
or results
of queries and manipulations
to others.

Here is a selection of them:

* A method,
that has been used
for a long time
and still is very popular,
is the *paper plan*.
Especially on construction sites
paper plans are still often used.
To create a paper plan, 
you can use a map in a print layout or a layout view in GIS
and then print it out on paper.
* The plan, which was created
in the print layout,
can also be stored as *PDF*
and then e.g.
be forwarded
by e-mail.
* Another method,
which is becoming more and more popular,
is the representation
of geodata on the Internet
in a so-called
*Web-GIS* or *Internet-GIS*.
* In addition,
the results of analyses
can also be output
in form of *tables*
or *graphics*.

Two of
these output types
we'd like to look at
more accurately
with some examples.
