== Presentation and output of data

In the last few chapters you've learned how geodata is captured, managed and 
analyzed. In the last chapter it's about the P of EVAP, the presentation of 
the data.

=== Learning objectives

After this chapter you will be able to to do the following:

* output the results of your queries in GIS in suitable form 
* name the important map elements

=== Theory

There are different possibilities to present or provide the visualized, newly 
recorded or changed data or results of queries and manipulations to others.

Here is a selection of them:

* A method, that has been used for a long time and still is very popular, is the 
*paper plan*. Especially on construction sites paper plans are still often 
used. To create a paper plan, you can use a map in a print layout or a layout 
view in GIS and then print it out on paper.
* The plan, which was created in the print layout, can also be stored as *PDF* 
and then e.g. be forwarded by e-mail.
* Another method, which is becoming more and more popular, is the representation 
of geodata on the Internet in a so-called *Web-GIS* or *Internet-GIS*.
* In addition, the results of analyses can also be output in form of *tables* or 
*graphics*.

Two of these output types we'd like to look at more accurately with some 
examples.

only. For some maps, the north arrow is replaced by a coordinate grid. This 
coordinate grid is always north-facing. +
* _Legend:_ To explain the contents of the map +
* _Scale/Scale bar:_ To be able to estimate distances on the map +

_Task 4_ +
_Create a concept for your own card using the findings from the cards you are 
looking at. This concept then applies to in the exercise part. The concept 
should consist of a sketch in which the position of the map and the map 
elements is determined. Also consider the following points when designing. 
Points:_

There is no clear solution to this problem. Just check again if the most 
important map elements are included.

* _what's the card supposed to say?_
* _whom do you want to address with your card (user group)?_


Are you satisfied with your concept? Then it's on to the implementation of 
this draft.

== QGIS Exercise

In this last exercise, the map design from the theory part will be implemented 
in GIS.

=== Learning objectives

At the end of this exercise you should have mastered the following points:

* Using QGIS, create a map that contains all important map elements
* Depending on the purpose of the card, select a suitable output format and 
justify your choice

=== Print composition

Before you can start creating the map, you must design the section of the map 
window as you would like it to appear on your map.
This includes showing and hiding layers, depending on whether you want to 
display them on the map or not. When you are satisfied with the presentation 
and the detail, you can continue with the exercise.

There is a separate mask for creating a map. Open it via the menu 
_Project_ ->
_New Print Layout..._.

.Empty Print Composition window in QGIS
image::einfuehrung_in_qgis/qgis_print_layout.PNG["Print composition", 510, 317]

The mask is structured in such a way that the menus and tools are again 
located in the upper area. The middle part is divided into two areas, on the 
left side is the map window, in which the map can be designed, and on the 
right side the corresponding parameters can be set and settings made.

On the right side there are three tabs, one named _Layout_, one named _Item 
Properties_ and one named _Guides_. Under _Layout_ you can make settings that 
affect the whole map. In contrast, the settings under _Item Properties_ only 
affect the currently selected element (e.g. map or legend).

Before you start designing the map, right-click on the white map and select 
_Page Properties_. This should select the _Page Properties_ tab on the right 
side, which you can then use to select the paper format for the map you want 
to design. Under _Size_ you have a choice of common paper formats as well as 
the option _Custom_, with which you can create your own format. Leave this 
setting at _A4_.

Under _Orientation_ you can choose between _Landscape_ and _Portrait_. Choose 
the format, which you have chosen in the theory part for your map design.

It also makes sense to place a grid over the map sheet where you can align the 
elements you place on the map. You have to activate the options _Show Grid_ 
and _Snap to Grid_ in the menu bar _View_ and set the _Grid spacing_ to 
10.00mm under the tab _Layout_ -> _Guides and Grid_.

Thus the general settings are made and it can be begun with the map 
organization.

First the layers should be displayed in the map. Click on the _Add Map_ button 
and draw a frame in the size you have chosen in your map design. The map 
section and the layers you selected at the beginning of the exercise will 
appear.

With the help of the button _Select/Move item_ the new map can be selected and 
the size can be changed by clicking on the border. Additionally the map can be 
moved in the print compilation. The size can also be determined in the _Item 
Properties_ tab under _Position and size_ by entering _Width_ and _Height_.

The _Move item content_ button can be used to move the content of the map. 
Under the _Item Properties_ tab under _Main properties_ you can also set the 
scale (_Scale_) and the rotation angle (_Map rotation_) of the map. If the 
coordinates of the extent of the section to be displayed are known, they can 
also be entered under _Extents_.

In addition, the option can be selected under _Grids_ whether a grid should be 
displayed above the map. For example, this grid can be of type _Cross_ or 
_Solid_ and additionally labeled. For Switzerland a grid interval of 25'000 m 
or 50'000 m would be suitable.

Under _Frame_ you can determine whether the frame around the map element 
should be displayed and if so, in which color and which line width.

Design your card element with the described possibilities. If you are 
satisfied with your result, you can save your settings by clicking the _Save 
project_ button.

Then add the other map elements you have on your design. The buttons can be 
found in the toolbar. If an element has been added, you can adjust these 
elements under the _Item Properties_ tab.

Are you done with your card and satisfied with what it looks like? Then check 
again to see if your card really contains all the important card elements. Is 
the _copyright_ for the data included? If so, then there's nothing standing in 
the way of bringing the card into a format that is suitable for distribution.

=== Prepare card for transfer

The map can be saved as a raster or as _SVG_, exported as _PDF_ or printed on 
a _printer_. Saving in raster format can be used, for example, if the map is 
to be included in a report. If you want to forward the map by e-mail, the PDF 
format is well suited. Often, however, printed plans are still used. Therefore 
you have this option in the mask _Printer composition_

In this exercise, a plan in the form of a __PDF__s is to be created. 
Therefore, click the _Export as PDF_ button, select the location and start 
creating the PDF. If the map also contains a _WMS_ service that is to be 
saved, the quality must be reduced in the _Layout_ tab under _Export settings_ 
before the _PDF_ is created, depending on the zoom level used.

Take a look at the map again in PDF format. Satisfied with it? Then it's time 
for the last chapter test.

== Chapter test 5

With the knowledge you acquired in the last chapter, it should be possible to 
answer the questions of the last chapter test. Write the answers to the 
questions again in your notebook or on a piece of paper. When you have 
answered all the questions, give the sheet to your teacher for correction.

=== Question 1

Let's come back to the situation from question 4 of chapter test 3: Your class 
teacher instructs you to create a GIS for the next school trip, on which the 
different intermediate stations of the trip and the hiking route are spatially 
represented. At the end you should pass on the GIS map to the other students 
in some way.

. _Which output format do you choose for the card?_ + Write down your choice and 
explain it in your own words. There are several real possibilities.
. _How do you design
the card in QGIS?_ +
Describe your actions 
in your own words. Do not 
look in the last chapter.
However, you are welcome to 
go through the individual 
steps while writing in the
QGIS program. Assume in your
explanation that the data 
has already been read into 
the GIS or newly entered and 
that the design of the layers
has already been completed.

=== Question 2

Again and again, be 
it in newspapers, 
books or on the Internet,
the spatial relationships
between data and events 
in a report are visualized
with the help of a map. 
But do these maps also 
contain the most important
map elements? +
You got to know these 
elements in this chapter 
and made your own experiences
with the design of a card. 
Look at the map under the link 
http://www.mygeo.info/landkarten/schweiz/schweiz_cia_2005.gif
and answered the 
following questions:

. _Are all important 
map elements included
in the map? If not, 
which ones are 
missing?_ +
Create a list of all
existing and non-existing
map elements. Also 
consider the effects 
of missing map elements.
. _How do you assess 
the implementation of
the map and the 
presentation of 
the information?_ +
_What's the card 
supposed to say?_ +
Answer the question in your
own words. When answering 
the question, also think of
your own experiences that
you made when designing 
your card.
