Welcome to the tutorial
"Introduction to the Opensource-Software QGIS".
Before you start with the tutorial
take a look to some information.
Please read these carefully.

== Introduction

=== Why GIS in class?

In many subjects contents are taught,
that have a room reference.
This room reference is visualized in a map sometimes,
but often not visualized at all.
Some students have trouble
without visualization of the topics
to recognize the spatial relationships.
By making computers more powerful and cheaper,
the students can also be offered the opportunity 
to work on projects such as the Matura thesis
on computers.

Through the representation of spatial contents
with the help of a Geographic Information System (GIS)
the students have the possibility to recognize spatial relationships better
and also to perform spatial analyses.
That's why the students at grammar school should
receive an introduction to the topic "Geographic Information Systems
and
get to know the basic functions of a GIS.
Therefore, they should have the opportunity
to use the program either in class or self-employed for the Matura thesis.

=== Learning objectives

You should be able to do the following after working through the tutorial:

* enumerate the functions and components of a GIS
* run a smaller GIS project
  from the project settings
  on the collection, management, analysis to the presentation of the data
* Distinguish raster data from vector data
  and
  also justify the distinction
* Create a map
  and
  implement the design in GIS

=== Procedure

After
the QGIS program is installed on the computer
and
you saved the data for this exercise locally on your computer,
you can start editing the tutorial.

The tutorial is divided into 5 chapters on the following topics:

* What is a Geographic Information System?
* Geodata and spatial reference
* Collection and management of data
* data analysis
* Presentation and output of data

Each individual chapter is again divided into the following 3 parts:
Theory, exercise and chapter test.
In the practice section you will get a theoretical introduction to the topic.
In the practice block, you have the opportunity
to deepen the theoretical knowledge
with the help of practical applications.
If you have the feeling
that you understood the content of the chapter,
then you can go to the chapter test.
This test must be solved without documentation and notes.
When you've answered all the questions
go with your answers to your teacher
or correct your answers yourself
with the solution sheet.
If your teacher corrects your answers
and the answers were right,
he'll give you the green light
to move on to the next chapter.
If you answered a question wrong
you have time
to go over the theory again
and
to answer the question again.
When the teacher is satisfied with your answer
you can move on to the next chapter.

In each chapter you will come across the following symbol again and again:
image:einfuehrung_in_qgis/ausrufezeichen.png["Ausrufe Zeichen", 15, 15].
This sign gives the hint
that you need to write something down.
So you must always have a piece of paper or a notebook at hand. 
Read through the question
and answer them in writing.
When you've answered them
you can compare your solution
with the solution
in the solution sheet.

Here the whole thing summarized:

. Work through theory
. Solving an exercise using the QGIS program
. Solve chapter test
. Have teacher's answers corrected.
If green light by teacher, proceed to 5.
If answers are incorrect, return to 3.
. Work through the theory of the next chapter
. ....

== Preparation

=== Installation of the GIS-Software QGIS

If you don't work with your own computer at school,
ask a teacher
if she can install the software on a computer for you
or
if it's already installed on a computer,
which you could use to work through the tutorial.

If you work with your own computer,
you can,
depending on how proficient you are with computers,
install the QGIS program yourself
or
ask someone
(e.g. your teacher or your parents),
if he/she can help you with the installation.

To install new software on a computer,
you need administrator rights.

Installing QGIS is not difficult.
The program can be downloaded from the following link:
http://www.qgis.org/

If the page is displayed in German,
you can change the language
by clicking on the englisch flag
above right of the homepage.
When you click on the "Download Now" button,
you get to the side
on which the program can be downloaded.
QGIS is available for the operating systems Windows, MacOS X and Linux.

Choose the right download for your operating system
and
download the installation file.

This guide was written for QGIS version 3.2.2-Bonn.
Therefore pay attention to download the following file:
QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.2.2-Setup-x86_64.exe
or
QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.2.2-Setup-x86.exe

NOTE: An alternative to installing the QGIS software
is the learning stick
https://lernstick.ch
(Currently only QGIS 2.18 is supported on the learning stick)
