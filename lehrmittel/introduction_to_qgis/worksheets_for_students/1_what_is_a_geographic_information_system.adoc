I'm sure you've heard or read about Geographic Information Systems or GIS 
somewhere already. Since computers have become more and more powerful and 
cheaper, more and more people are able to buy a computer, who has enough 
computing power, to run a GIS program. Therefore, the number of GIS 
applications has risen. But what exactly do you understand under a Geographic 
Information System? We will answer this question in the first chapter.

== Learning objectives of the theory

After the completion of the first chapter you should have learned the following:

* Know the components which are needed for a Geographic Information System.
* List the functionalities of a Geographic Information System without help.

== Theory

To help understand what a Geographic Information System is, we have here a 
definition for it:

.Definition
[NOTE]
====
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer supported System, which is 
made out of Hardware, Software and Data and with witch one can model and 
modify spatial problems in different fields of application. The 
data/information required for this can be digitally edited, managed, 
reorganized, analyzed and presented both alphanumerically and graphically. GIS 
denominates a technology as well as both a product and a means to access and 
modify geographic information.

_Exercise 1_ +
_Study the definition and try to answer the following questions:_

._What infrastructure is required to use a GIS?_ ._What's special about the 
data shown in a GIS?_ ._Chalkin created the Fourcomponent Model in the year 
1977. He described the function of a GIS with 4 components Input, 
Manipulation, Analysis and Presentation, short IMAP. Exercise: Order each of 
these components to one of the functions mentioned in the definition._

. _You'll need the hardware (at least keyboard and Screen, or a laptop plus a 
mouse) and the software (operating system and GIS software)_
._The data has a spatial reference._
. *I* (Input): _modelled, digitally acquired, saved_ +
*M* (Manipulate): _edited, reorganized_ +

== Components of a Geographic Information System

We know to get deeper into the individual system components _Hardware, 
Software and Data_ and tell you something more about them.

=== Hardware

The most important hardware component that belong to a GIS are already 
mentioned in exercise 1a, a computer with keyboard, display and mouse. 
Beside peripherals like printer and a means to read in data, (see Chapter 
"Data Collection and Management") for example a GPS or scanner.

=== Software

To even run a GIS on your computer you'll need an operating system. The most 
common ones are Microsoft Windows, Apple Max OS X, Unix and Linux.

Once an operating system is present you can install the GIS software. The 
choice is dependent on your operating system, since not every GIS supports 
each one.

The common GIS products can be divided into two classes. On one hand 
commercial products like ArcGIS from ESRI or Geomedia from Intergraph and on 
the other hand open source projects like QGIS, which are free to use.

For products to be allowed to run under open source, they need to comply with 
the open source license. This license gives user the allowance to freely use, 
modify and spread of the software. Access to the source code is unrestricted, 
but the user also has a few obligations. But these mostly concern development 
and passing around of the product and have of no further implication for our 
tutorial.

You surely have heard the term free software or freeware. Freeware isn't the 
same as open source software. They don't cost anything but you can't access 
the source code.

In this tutorial we'll use the open source software QGIS, which runs on most 
operating systems.

We chose QGIS because it lacks licensing cost and is free to install on any 
computer. You can use it both in school and at home without paying anything.

If there is a problem when using the software, you won't have the support 
offered by companies like ESRI or Intergraph. 
But behind every open source software stands a community. So don't be afraid 
to contact them if you're facing problems or read trough the documentation. 
You can find out more about this under the following links:

* Community: https://www.qgis.org/de/site/forusers/support.html
* Documentation: https://www.qgis.org/de/docs/index.html

=== Data

As you can see from the definition, the data in a GIS is spatial data.
You will learn more about this topic in the next chapter.

=== Uses

A further component are the applications that are made in a GIS.
These range from simple visualizations to complex analyses.
You, too, will carry out some applications within this tutorial.

=== Summary component

image:einfuehrung_in_qgis/ausrufezeichen.png[, 15, 15]
_Exercise 2_ +
_Repeat for yourself the different components of a GIS and write down a few 
words about each of them and not what they are in your case._

ifdef::show_solutions[]
====
On your workspace their is probably a computer with a screen, keyboard and a 
mouse. Or perhaps it's just a laptop with a mouse. You might only have a 
simple printer and scanner, but thanks to technological advancement you don't 
need very expensive equipment for a GIS.

Your OS is probably Windows, Mac OS X, Linux or Unix.

And your GIS software is probably QGIS which you installed in the Chapter 
"Preparation".

== QGIS exercise

In the first part of the theory you've learned that software is one of four 
components of the GIS system. In this exercise part you now learn how to use 
QGIS.

=== Learning objectives

After this exercise you will be able to:

* open existing projects in QGIS
* name and use the different navigation options

=== Starting QGIS

When you installed the QGIS software, it automatically created a folder with 
shortcuts for the program on your desktop.
You can double click on that shortcut (named QGIS + version number) to start 
the program. Doing that opens a simple graphical user interface.
If this shortcut is missing, you find the program if you use your computers 
search function. Make sure you open the version that doesn't have "with Grass" 
on it.

=== The graphical user interface

The user interface is separated into seven areas:

. Menubar
. Toolbar
. Spatial bookmarks
. Browser window
. Layer window
. Map window
. Status bar

.User interface of QGIS 3
image::einfuehrung_in_qgis/qgis_benutzeroberflaeche.PNG["QGIS Benutzeroberfläche", 401, 312]

Can you find each area on your own user interface?

If you can't see the layer or the browser you can get them via _View_ -> 
_Panels_ and _Layers_ or _Browser_.

From the menu _View_ -> _Toolbars_ you can get the lists of toolboxes. You can 
add and remove them to your interface by setting the cross in front of its name.

Another option to show and hide the layer window, map overview or toolboxes is 
using the right mouse button. Simply click with it on the grey dotted boarder 
and options menu opens up.

.List with tools
image::einfuehrung_in_qgis/qgis_werkzeugliste.png["Werkzeuge hinzufügen", 190, 266]

Try out these three methods und find out which one you like the most, for use 
in the future.

Hide the window "Spatial Bookmarks" and show the window "Overview" instead.

=== Open existing project

In this task we will work with an existing QGIS project. But first we'll need 
to load the project into our QGIS. Klick for that on the button _Open Project_ 
and navigate to where you saved the data for this tutorial. Select the file 
Teil1.qgs and click on the "Open" button.

In the Layers window you should now be able to see two entries, Lakes and 
Canton borders. These entries are called layers and are shown graphically in 
the map window.

=== Layer window and map window

For a first step we should take a closer look at the interaction between Layer 
window and Map window.

Die individual layers can be shown and hidden by checking the cross in front 
of the layer name. Test this function by showing and hiding both layers in the 
Map window.

TIP: If you can't see the lake or cantons boarders you can right-click the 
layer and select _Zoom to Layer_.

The order in the map view corresponds on the order in the layer window. So, 
the lakes entry in the layer window is above the cantons boarders layer, and 
the same will be true in the map window.

You can change the order of the layers. Simply click on the layer and move it 
up or down, try it with the lake layer and look what happens.

Return finally the layers back to their original position.

=== Navigation in the map window

Before you start to navigate on the map, you should set a background for the 
field _Overview_. The canton boarders would be perfect for that, just right 
click the layer and set the check the option _Show in Overview_. The canton 
boarders are now visible in the map overview. 
You can add as many layers as you like.
The display order is taken from the order in the layer window.

The tools for navigation in the map window can be found in the toolbox _Map 
Navigation Toolbar_.

image:einfuehrung_in_qgis/ausrufezeichen.png[, 15, 15]
_Exercise 3_ +
_Try out the different tools of the toolbox map navigation and write down in 
your own words what each one does, pay attention to what happens in the 
overview as well._

NOTE: For the navigation in the map window you can use mouse wheel and keyboard 
as well. 
Holding spacebar will and the middle mouse button, you can move the map 
without changing your current tool.

Solutions:

* Move map
* Move map to selected Object
* Zoom in
* Zoom out
* Zoom to own resolution
* Full expanse
* Zoom to selection
* Zoom to layer
* Zoom back
* Zoom forward

_What happens in the map overview during navigation?_

The red rectangle matches the section in the map window. +

If the red rectangle is moved in the overview, the map view matches it as well.
====
endif::show_solutions[]

image:einfuehrung_in_qgis/ausrufezeichen.png[, 15, 15]
_Exercise 4_ +
_Try the following points and make notes of what happens._

* _Move the mouse wheel forward and backwards while the cursor is on the map._
* _Following keys on the keyboard_
** _Arrow keys_
** _Page Up/Page Down_
** _Hold space down and move your pointer over the map window._

ifdef::show_solutions[]
====
*When you move the mouseweel forward or backward on the map, you can zoom in 
and out. The cursor becomes the center of the zoom.
* The keys do the following:
** _Arrow Keys_ move the map in the corresponding direction.
** _PageUp/PageDown_ Zooms in and out by a predefined factor, which is the 
same as with the mouseweel.
**_Space bar_ Holding it while moving the cursor over the map the map view is 
being panned with the cursor.

NOTE: You can change the zoom factor under _Settings_ -> _Options..._ -> _Map 
Toos_, the default value is _200%_.

Once you're finished with all the exercises you can save the project under a 
different name, for example *Part1_solved.qgs*

=== Chapter test 1

With the help of the chapter test, you can check if you understood the current 
information of this worksheet.
It serves as an assessment. You should only continue if you understood 
everything in this chapter.

To do so, write all the answers down. Once you've finished them all give it to 
your teacher to check.

=== Question 1

Somebody asks you what a GIS is and what it can do.

_What do you answer?_

Think about the first three question in the theory part and write down bullet 
points of what they contained.

ifdef::show_solutions[]
====
.Solution
A GIS (Geographic Information System) allows you to work with spatial data.
You can capture and save (*input*) change, administrate and reorganize 
(*manipulate*).
You can analyse (*analyse*) the data and present them either graphically or as 
text (*Presentation*).

A GIS covers all classic components of data management (Input, Manipulate, 
Analysis, Presentation, *IMAP*), but specifically for *geographical* 
information.
====
endif::show_solutions[]

=== Question 2

During the exercise you've learned some functions to adapt the view in the map 
window to your requirements. _Which tools and options did you get introduced 
to navigate the Map?_

Write down 3 option and explain what they do in a few words.

ifdef::show_solutions[]
====
.Solution
* Move map
* Move map to selected object
* Zoom in
* Zoom out
* Zoom to own resolution (100%)
* Full extent
* Zoom to selection
* Zoom to layer
* Zoom back
* Zoom forward
====
endif::show_solutions[]

=== Question 3

Think about the classes you have (had) in school.

._In which class and in which specific part of the class would the use of a_ 
_GIS make sense?_ +
Write down which topics would make sense and why. Don't only think about the 
class you're in right now.

._What would a GIS in that subject contain?_ +
Describe in a few sentences what kind of data the GIS should have and what GIS 
functions you would use.

ifdef::show_solutions[]
====
.Lösung
* Geography
** Cartography (finished maps as raster data or basic map data as vector data).
** "Postal carrier" geography (administrative areas countries, districts, 
municipalities etc. and their main locations as area and point vector data).
** Climatology (temperature or other climate data, possibly as raster data).
* Computer Science: Working with specialized computer systems and applications.
