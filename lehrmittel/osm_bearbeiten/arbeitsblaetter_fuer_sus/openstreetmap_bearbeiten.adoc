use the iD-Editor to enter a bench, a well or a waste bin

*A worksheet for students*

NOTE: With this worksheet and the "tour" (a software-guided introductory course) built into the online OpenStreetMap editor "iD", you will learn how to edit OpenStreetMap data with this editor. This way you can improve and complete the map yourself.

On OpenStreetMap you can not only view the world map, but also edit it. To add or change data, you first need a user account.

== Create and login user account
  
To create an account, press the "Register" button at the top right. You have to enter your email address and choose a username and password. If you already have an OpenStreetMap user account, you can of course click on "Login" instead.

After you have clicked your way through the registration process, OpenStreetMap sends you an email and the address you entered to check if you can really be reached via this email address. In this email message you will find a confirmation link that you must visit to complete the registration process

== iD, the web editor of OpenStreetMap

There are several editors that can be used to edit OpenStreetMap. We will use the editor called "iD", which is already installed on the openstreetmap.org website.

=== Walkthrough

To get to know this editor, you should first work through its built-in "walkthough". To do this, press the "Edit"-button in the upper left corner. If a welcome message is then displayed, click on "Start tour". Otherwise press the image:osm_editieren/help_button.PNG["Help Button", 20, 20]-button (on the right side) scroll down from the window that slides int and click on "Start the Walkthrough" to begin the walkthrough.


=== And here we go!
All changes you made during the "walkthrough" were for practice only and were not really entered in OpenStreetMap.

Is something missing on the OpenStreetMap map, or is something even wrong? Perhaps you notice something at your place of residence or in the area of your school building that can be improved or supplemented. For example, is there a bench, a fountain or a waste bin that is still missing?

Since you learned in the walkthrough how to enter and change things in OpenStreetMap, you can now enter what is missing and correct what is wrong!

Your changes will be made and applied to the map within 5-30 minutes!

[NOTE]
====
OpenStreetMap saves object properties as tags.
You can see this on the left side of the iD editor after selecting an object, as you can see in <<properties_closed>>.

If you expand the field "All properties", you will see all tags of the object, as in <<properties_expanded>>.

If you don't know which tag to use, you can check the cheatsheet.
====

[[eigenschaften_zugeklappt]]
.The tags can be found in the "All Properties" section, which may be closed.

[[eigenschaften_aufgeklappt]]
.The "All properties" section can be opened by clicking
image::osm_editieren/eigenschaften_aufgeklappt.PNG["Eigenschaften aufgeklappt"]

If you haven't noticed anything that needs changing or adding, click on the OpenStreetMap logo in the upper left corner to exit the iD Editor and return to the map. Then click on the "Layers"-button (the one with the stacked areas image:osm_editieren/osm_ebene_icon.PNG["Area-Icon", 25, 25] as icon) and select the checkbox "Notes/Error messages". See if you see notes from other map users indicating errors or omissions that you can fix by making changes. When you have found something, click on "Edit" again.
